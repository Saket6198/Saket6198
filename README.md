I'm **Saket**, a full-stack developer who loves turning ideas into clean, functional code — and occasionally into bugs I pretend are features.

I work across the stack, from crafting responsive UIs to wrestling with backend logic and deployment quirks. Always learning, always building, and sometimes even reading docs.
